# Anypoint Template: Salesforce to Salesforce Contact Bidirectional Synchronization

Bi-directionally synchronizes contact data between two Salesforce organizations. This template makes it fast to configure the fields to synchronize, how they map, and criteria on when to trigger the synchronization. 

Parent accounts are created if they donâ€™t already exist in the destination org, or this template can be configured to link all contact created to a specific account. This template can trigger either using the Mule polling mechanism or can be easily modified to work with Salesforce outbound messaging to better utilize Salesforce API calls. 

This template leverages watermarking functionality to ensure that only the most recent items are synchronized and batch to effectively process many records at a time.

# Use Case
As a Salesforce administrator I want to have my contacts synchronized between two different Salesforce organizations.

This template serves as a foundation for setting an online bidirectional sync of contacts between 
two Salesforce instances, and being able to specify filtering criteria. 

The  main behavior for the integration is polling for changes in new contacts or modified ones using the scheduler 
component. The polled changes are for those that have occurred in any of the Salesforce instances during a  
defined period of time. For those contacts that have not been updated yet, the integration triggers an 
upsert (update or create depending the case) taking the last modification as the one that should be applied.

Requirements have been set not only to be used as examples, but also to establish starting points 
to adapt the integration to any given requirements.

# Considerations

To make this template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of 
them deal with the preparations in both, that must be made for all to run smoothly. Failing 
to do so can lead to unexpected behavior of the template.



## Salesforce Considerations

Here's what you need to know about Salesforce to get this template to work.

### FAQ

- Where can I check that the field configuration for my Salesforce instance is the right one? See: <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=checking_field_accessibility_for_a_particular_field.htm&language=en_US">Salesforce: Checking Field Accessibility for a Particular Field</a>
- Can I modify the Field Access Settings? How? See: <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=modifying_field_access_settings.htm&language=en_US">Salesforce: Modifying Field Access Settings</a>

### As a Data Source

If the user who configured the template for the source system does not have at least *read only* permissions for the fields that are fetched, then an *InvalidFieldFault* API fault displays.

```
java.lang.RuntimeException: [InvalidFieldFault [ApiQueryFault [ApiFault  exceptionCode='INVALID_FIELD'
exceptionMessage='
Account.Phone, Account.Rating, Account.RecordTypeId, Account.ShippingCity
^
ERROR at Row:1:Column:486
No such column 'RecordTypeId' on entity 'Account'. If you are attempting to use a custom field, be sure to append the '__c' after the custom field name. Reference your WSDL or the describe call for the appropriate names.'
]
row='1'
column='486'
]
]
```

### As a Data Destination

There are no considerations with using Salesforce as a data destination.









# Run it!
Simple steps to get Salesforce to Salesforce Contact Bidirectional Synchronization running.
To have your application up and running:

1. Configure the application properties.
2. Run it on premises or in CloudHub (Runtime Manager).

## Running On Premises
In this section we help you run your template on your computer.


### Where to Download Anypoint Studio and the Mule Runtime
If you are a newcomer to Mule, here is where to get the tools.

+ [Download Anypoint Studio](https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/studio)
+ [Download Mule runtime](https://www.mulesoft.com/lp/dl/mule-esb-enterprise)


### Importing a Template into Studio
In Studio, click the Exchange X icon in the upper left of the taskbar, log in with your
Anypoint Platform credentials, search for the template, and click **Open**.


### Running on Studio
After you import your template into Anypoint Studio, follow these steps to run it:

+ Locate the properties file `mule.dev.properties`, in src/main/resources.
+ Complete all the properties required as per the examples in the "Properties to Configure" section.
+ Right click the template project folder.
+ Hover your mouse over `Run as`
+ Click `Mule Application (configure)`
+ Inside the dialog, select Environment and set the variable `mule.env` to the value `dev`
+ Click `Run`


### Running on Mule Standalone
Fill in the properties in one of the property files, for example in 
mule.dev.properties, and run your app 
with the corresponding environment variable to use it. To follow the example, use the `mule.env=dev` value. 


## Running on CloudHub
While creating your application on CloudHub (or you can do it later as a next step), go to Runtime Manager > Manage Application > Properties to set the environment variables listed in "Properties to Configure" as well as the **mule.env**.
To create your application on CloudHub, go to Anypoint Platform > Runtime Manager > Deployment > Advanced 
to set the environment variables listed in "Properties to Configure" as well as in the **mule.env** file.

### Deploying your Anypoint Template on CloudHub
Studio provides an easy way to deploy your template directly to CloudHub, for the specific steps to do so check this


## Properties to Configure
To use this template, configure properties (credentials, configurations, etc.) in the properties file or in CloudHub from Runtime Manager > Manage Application > Properties. The sections that follow list example values.
### Application Configuration
#### Application Configuration

+ scheduler.frequency `10000`  
The milliseconds between two different checks for updates in either Salesforce instance.

+ scheduler.startDelay `0`

+ watermark.default.expression `"2018-02-25T11:00:00.000Z"`  
This property is important, as it configures the starting point of the synchronization. If the 
use case includes synchronization for every contact created from the beginning of the time, you should use a 
date previous to any contact creation, such as `"1900-01-01T08:00:00.000Z"`). 
If you want to synchronize the contacts created from now on, then use a default value according to 
that requirement, for example, if today is April 21, 2018 and eleven o'clock in London, 
use the `"2018-04-21T11:00:00.000Z"` value.

+ page.size `1000`

+ account.sync.policy `syncAccount`
**Note:** the property **account.sync.policy** can take any of the two following values: 
+ **empty_value**: If the property has no value assigned to it then application will do nothing in what respect to the account and it'll just move the contact over.
+ **syncAccount**: It tries to create the contact's account when it is not pressented in the Salesforce instance B.

#### SalesForce Connector Configuration for Company A

+ sfdc.a.username `aunt.eater@mail.com`
+ sfdc.a.password `G0ttaF1ndTh3m!!`
+ sfdc.a.securityToken `avsfwCUl7apQs56Xq2AKi3X`
+ sfdc.a.url `https://login.salesforce.com/services/Soap/u/42.0`
+ sfdc.a.integration.user.id `A0ed000BO9T`

**Note:** To find the correct *sfdc.a.integration.user.id* value, refer to the 
example project "Salesforce Data Retrieval" in Anypoint Exchange. You can also open the User record in Salesforce Classic mode and see this value in the browser URL.

#### SalesForce Connector Configuration for Company B

+ sfdc.b.username `polly.hedra@example.com`
+ sfdc.b.password `WootWoot99!!`
+ sfdc.b.securityToken `ces56arl7apQs56XTddf34X`
+ sfdc.b.url `https://login.salesforce.com/services/Soap/u/42.0`
+ sfdc.b.integration.user.id `B0ed000BO9T`

**Note:** To find the correct *sfdc.b.integration.user.id* value, refer to the example 
project "Salesforce Data Retrieval" in Anypoint Exchange. You can also open the User record in Salesforce Classic mode and see this value in the browser URL.

# API Calls
Not relevant for this use case.


# Customize It!
This brief guide intends to give a high level idea of how this template is built and how you can change it according to your needs.
As Mule applications are based on XML files, this page describes the XML files used with this template.

More files are available such as test classes and Mule application files, but to keep it simple, we focus on these XML files:

* config.xml
* businessLogic.xml
* endpoints.xml
* errorHandling.xml


## config.xml
Configuration for connectors and configuration properties are set in this file. Even change the configuration here, all parameters that can be modified are in properties file, which is the recommended place to make your changes. However if you want to do core changes to the logic, you need to modify this file.

In the Studio visual editor, the properties are on the *Global Element* tab.


## businessLogic.xml
This file holds the functional aspect of the template. Its main component is a Mule batch job, and 
it includes steps for both executing the synchronization from Salesforce A to Salesforce B, and the other way around.



## endpoints.xml
Use this file to contain each inbound and outbound endpoint for your integration app. 
In this template, this file contains a scheduler endpoint that queries Salesforce A and Salesforce B 
for updates using watermark.



## errorHandling.xml
Use this file for how your integration reacts depending on the different exceptions. This file 
holds an error handler that is referenced by the scheduler flow in the endpoints XML file.
